# Line-Following-Robot-Arduino-
A line follower robot, as the name suggests, is an automated guided vehicle, which follow a visual line embedded on the floor or ceiling. Usually, the visual line is the path in which the line follower robot goes and it will be a black line on a white surface but the other way (white line on a black surface) is also possible.
The bot uses 5 IR sensors for line detection. The code is written using simple in C++ without integrating proportional–integral–derivative (PID) algorithm.
